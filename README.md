# Message-Encryption-App
A short C# windows forms application that allows you to enter a message, as well as an encryption key and on the click of a button you can encrypt/decrypt your message. I learnt how to do this by means of a YouTube tutorial by Rhys Ramsay and added my own colours and comments.
